# Tic-Tac-Toe

I created a simple and responsive **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- The game board consists of 9 clickable boxes arranged in a 3x3 grid.
- Two players alternate turns: Player O and Player X.
- On each turn, the current player clicks an empty box to place their symbol (O or X).
- The boxes are disabled once filled to prevent overwriting.
- The game automatically checks for a winning condition after every move.
    - If three of the same symbols (either O or X) are aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, a win is declared for that player.
    - If all boxes are filled and there is no winner, the game declares a draw.
- A message is displayed to show the winner or if the game is a draw.
- Players can reset the game at any time using the "Reset" or "New Game" buttons, which clear the board and restart the game.

The game is fully responsive and works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
